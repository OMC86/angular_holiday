						and honesty displayed throughout.

					Experience the full spectacle of natures wonder.
				</p>
				<p>
					Montserrat is a volcanic island and forms part of the volcanic arc of the Lesser Antilles.
					The island was still trying to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 when
					after 500 years of dormancy seismic activity started on Montserrat
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1995, the Soufriere Hills Volcano on Montserrat erupted and over the next two years destroyed
					the island’s capital city of Plymouth, causing two thirds of the island to be declared an exclusion
					zone. Photos attest to the suddenness of the volcano’s eruption, which caused people to flee,
					leaving behind stores packed with merchandise and homes filled with belongings, now coated in more
					than 15 feet of volcanic ash.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prior to the volcano there were over 12,000 people living on this island and it had an extremely
					active tourist and agriculture-based economy. The airport was about to be expanded and celebrity
					musicians were regular visitors to George Martin’s AIR studios, where the likes of Paul McCartney
					and Elton John recorded albums. George Martin’s house in the village of Salem has since been reborn
					as one of the island’s hotels, Olveston House.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plymouth is now known as the modern day Pompeii, visitors can experience the eeriness and
					astounding wonder of natures triumph. Either viewed from a distance at the Montserrat Volcano
					Observatory or on foot with a guided tour into the exclusion zone, travellers can see the marvel of
					the volcano.
				</p>
				<p>
					A scattering of department stores and government buildings still hold their heads in a landscape
					of ash and boulders. Vegetation has grown over homes and buildings which escaped the pyroclastic
					flows and in the lobby of a luxury hotel outside town, dusty papers still sit on the reception desk.
				</p>
				<p>
					Montserrat is on the rebuild, the current hazard level on the mountainous Caribbean island is
					Level 1, which indicates more than one year without measured activity. New economy lies in
					extracting and exporting sand from the volcanic ash. Even more significant is the drilling of three
					geothermal wells, which should generate 200 years’ worth of power.

					Montserrat's Irish heritage dates back to the 17th century. The island became a haven for Irish
					Catholics who were affected by anti-Catholic legislations in Great Britain and Ireland.
					The predominantly Irish population of Montserrat is evident in the 1678 census which indicates
					that Seventy percent of Montserrat’s white population self-identified as ancestry can be
					identified today through the fact that the majority of the islanders have an Irish surname.

				<p>Soon slaves outnumbered the planters and started to rebel. In 1768, the slaves planned an
					island-wide attack on St. Patrick's Day, when the planters would be celebrating. Servants were
					instructed to grab all the weapons they could find inside the Government House while field slaves
					stormed the building with rocks, farm tools, clubs and homemade swords.
				</p>

				<p>
					Despite months of plotting, their plans had been leaked and their revolt was unsuccessful

						The week-long St Patrick's festival provides a dynamic mix of Irish and African heritage,

					<p class="snippet float">Guinness and 'Green' Heineken are available in bars aside the customary

						Much of the activity on St Patrick's Day itself (March 17th) will centre around Festival
						Village, in the town of Salem. Here, stalls will sell traditional food such as salted codfish
						and sweet potato, “Dookna'' and play games such as “Zig Zag Zaggett” similar to marbles but
						played with cashew seeds.

				<p>Masquerade dancing is a focal aspect of the celebrations, masked dancers in costumes complete with
					bells, ribbons and attractive headdress resembling a bishop mitre, put on colourful displays of
					dance in a playful mockery of the one-time slave masters.
				</p>

				<p>During St Patrick's Day, visitors will notice many locals wearing national dress - in which green
					is the dominant colour and both Guinness and 'Green' Heineken are available in bars alongside the
					customary rum punch cocktails.

				<p>
					African-inspired events such as the Freedom Run and masquerade dancing, commemorate the slave
					history in Montserrat, specifically the unsuccessful uprising that took place on St Patrick's Day
					in 1768.
