				<p>Montserrat, known as the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean for its lush green rainforest and for the Irish history ingrained in the ancestry of the island. Located in the Leeward Islands, part of the chain known as the Lesser Antilles, in the British West Indies, It is a British Overseas Territory and has a UK-appointed governor.</p>
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>To get there you need to take a small plane or ferry from neighbouring Antigua. Different from other islands Montserrat is the unspoilt Caribbean. Crime is almost unknown in this peaceful, under populated country, it’s home to about 5,000 people and the sense of community is evident with values of courtesy and honesty displayed.</p>

					Montserrat’s Georgian era capital city, Plymouth, was submerged under the pyroclastic flow from the eruption which started in 1995 and caused two thirds of the island’s population to flee. Fewer than 1200 people stayed on the island as of 1997, rising to nearly 5000 by 2016. </p>

					<p>The volcano has been relatively quiet since 2010, but is still closely monitored. In fact it is the most studied volcano in the world!</p>
					</div>

					 <p>The designated “Exclusion Zone” is deceptive as access is now permitted and Plymouth, also known as a “modern day Pompeii” can be viewed from nearby vantage points, as well as from the sea.  The Montserrat Volcano Observatory is open to the public where you can learn more about the volcano and get a prime view of it.</p>

					<p>Before the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat was a carefree island paradise with a thriving community. It was also an exclusive, and very private holiday destination.

				<p>Montserrat's Irish heritage dates back to the 17th century. The island became a haven for Irish Catholics who were affected by anti-Catholic legislations in Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

				<p>The predominantly Irish population of Montserrat is evident in the 1678 census which indicates that Seventy percent of Montserrat’s white population self-identified as Irish.

				<p>During the plantation era, colonists built an economy on sugar, rum, arrowroot and sea island cotton. Planters emerged from among the island’s Irish residents and the importation of African slaves began.

				<p> Soon slaves outnumbered the planters and started to rebel.  In 1768, the slaves planned an island-wide attack on St. Patrick's Day, when the planters would be celebrating. Servants were instructed to grab all the weapons they could find inside the Government House while field slaves stormed the building with rocks, farm tools, clubs and homemade swords. </p>

				<p>Despite months of plotting, their plans had been leaked and their revolt was unsuccessful resulting in the brutal killing of nine plot leaders.

				<p>Montserrat is the only country outside Ireland where St Patrick's Day is a public holiday.</p>

					<p>The week-long St Patrick's festival provides a dynamic mix of Irish and African heritage, with some traditional Caribbean entertainment thrown in, to make this one of Montserrat's most popular annual events.</p>
				
					<p class="snippet float">Guinness and 'Green' Heineken are available in bars aside the customary rum punch cocktails.</p>
				
					<p>Much of the activity on St Patrick's Day itself (March 17th) will centre around Festival Village, in the town of Salem. Here, stalls will sell traditional food such as salted codfish and sweet potato, ``dookna'' and play games such as ``Zig Zag Zaggett‘’ similar to marbles but played with cashew seeds.</p>
				
				</div>

				<p>Masquerade dancing is a focal aspect of the celebrations, masked dancers in costumes complete with bells, ribbons and attractive headdress resembling a bishop mitre, put on colourful displays of dance in a playful mockery of the one-time slave masters.</p>

				<p>During St Patrick's Day, visitors will notice many locals wearing national dress - in which green is the dominant colour - and both Guinness and 'Green' Heineken are available in bars aside the customary rum punch cocktails.</p>

				<p>African-inspired events such as the Freedom Run fun-run and masquerade dancing, commemorate the slave history in Montserrat, specifically the unsuccessful uprising that took place on St Patrick's Day in 1768.</p>
