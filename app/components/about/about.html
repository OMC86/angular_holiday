				<p>"I’m Rochelle Lee, British born Montserratian descendant and founder of Emerald Travel MS. Having experienced St Patricks Day in the UK and the Caribbean, it is through seeing a week of events built up to one historic day that makes the experience one worth travelling for year after year.</p>

				<p>It was during the time I spent working on the island that I grew to appreciate all that the island has to offer and recognise the appeal for various types of people. </p>

				<p>With my passion, knowledge and experience of the Island we have tailor made a package holiday for the average holiday maker that wouldn’t know where to start and how best to explore the island.”
